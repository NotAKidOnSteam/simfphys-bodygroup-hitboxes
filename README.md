# simfphys-bodygroup-hitboxes
WIP, a hopefully somewhat working damage script for some GTASA Simfphys vehicles. Throwing it on GitHub to make sure while I am tweaking things I have backups.


# features
* Hitboxes for bodygroup based damage for use with Simfphys Lua Base.
* Explode vehicle when fuel cap is shot.
* Health variables for making bodygroups strong or weak (glass or armour)
* Debug convars to render the hitboxes clientside for visualization and tweaking.




**you will need to use something like pac3 to get the vectors for the hitboxes**

This addon does not include any tools to create hitboxes easily, just allows for specifying them. _Maybe at a later date._

# videos (in order of creation to now)
First itteration of the addon, not much included other than breaking when shot.

# disclaimer
*The code is shit.* Some parts of the script are not perfected yet and will be reworked once I've finally found and implemented all the features needed.
well, actually supine rewrote it a few times in typescript or somethin and now it actually look profesional.

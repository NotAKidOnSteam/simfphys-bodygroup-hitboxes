# simfphys-bodygroup-hitboxes
WIP, a hopefully somewhat working damage script for some GTASA Simfphys vehicles. Throwing it on GitHub to make sure while I am tweaking things I have backups.


# features
* Hitboxes for bodygroup based damage for use with Simfphys Lua Base.
* Explode vehicle when fuel cap is shot.
* Health variables for making bodygroups strong or weak (glass or armour)
* Debug convars to render the hitboxes clientside for visualization and tweaking.




**you will need to use something like pac3 to get the vectors for the hitboxes**

This addon does not include any tools to create hitboxes easily, just allows for specifying them. _Maybe at a later date._

# videos (in order of creation to now)
First itteration of the addon, not much included other than breaking when shot.

Update, bodygroups drop and spawn gibs with the vehicles color.
